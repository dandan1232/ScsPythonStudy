# 编写程序打开一个文本文件Mary.txt，读取每一行并在每一行的前面加上行号，保存到输出文件中。如果输入文件内容为：
# Mary had a little lamb,
# Whose fleece was white as snow.
# And everywhere that Mary went,
# The lamb was sure to go!
# 那么程序生成的输出文件内容为：
# /* 1 */ Mary had a little lamb,
# /* 2 */ Whose fleece was white as snow.
# /* 3 */ And everywhere that Mary went,
# /* 4 */ The lamb was sure to go!
# 提示用户提供输入文件和输出文件的名字。
