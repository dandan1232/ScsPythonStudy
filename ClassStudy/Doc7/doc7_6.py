# A major drawback of cross-network recommender solutions is that they can only be applied to users that are overlapped across networks.
# Thus, the non-overlapped users, which form the majority of users are ignored.
# As a solution, we propose CnGAN, a novel multi-task learning based recommend architecture.
# 编写一个函数，要求实现以下功能：
# 1）统计有多少个不同的单词；
# 2）根据每个单词ASCII码值的和（单词they ASCII码值的和是：116+104+101+121=442）对单词进行从小到大的排序，重复出现的单词只算一次的和，按行输出单词及对应的和。
